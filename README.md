# JerryScript Reduction Test Suite

The repository contains test files that caused various errors in the JerryScript
lightweight JavaScript engine. The inputs are located in the `tests` folder,
denoted by the issue number from the official GitHub repository.

The structure of each test case is as follows:

* `<issue-number>/`
  * `<issue-number>-orig.js`: Fuzzer-generated input that originally caused the
    error.
  * `hash.txt`: The JerryScript commit hash that reproduces the error.
  * `test.sh`: (generated by the scripts) Oracle for checking if the error is
    still present (`return code 0`) or not (`return code 1`).
  * `<issue-number>-jerry`: (generated by the scripts) Compiled JerryScript
    engine that contains the error.

The `tools` folder contains the proper ANTLR v4 grammar for the JavaScript
language and additional Python scripts for supporting measurements.

To see how the oracle scripts are generated, and the JerryScript engine is built,
check the `demo.py` script.
